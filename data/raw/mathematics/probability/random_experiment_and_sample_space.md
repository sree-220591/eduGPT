# Random Experiment and Sample Space

## 1. Core Idea
A random experiment is an action or process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty in advance, even if it is repeated under the same conditions.

The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space.

## 2. Why It Matters
Probability is about uncertainty. Random experiments help us model real-life situations where outcomes are not fixed, such as tossing a coin, rolling a die, or checking whether it rains tomorrow.

Without defining the sample space, we cannot calculate probabilities correctly.

## 3. Key Definitions
- Random Experiment: An experiment with more than one possible outcome, where the exact outcome is uncertain.
- Outcome: A possible result of a random experiment.
- Sample Space (S): The set containing all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

## 4. Simple Examples
- Tossing a coin:
  Sample Space, S = {Head, Tail}

- Rolling a die:
  Sample Space, S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

- Tossing two coins:
  Sample Space, S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}

## 5. Common Misunderstandings
- Thinking a random experiment gives different outcomes every time. It may repeat the same outcome.
- Confusing an outcome with an event.
- Forgetting to list all possible outcomes in the sample space.

## 6. One-Line Summary
A random experiment produces uncertain outcomes, and the sample space lists all possible outcomes.
