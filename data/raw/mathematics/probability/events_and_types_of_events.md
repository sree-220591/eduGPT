# Events and Types of Events

## 1. Core Idea
An event is a specific outcome or a group of outcomes of a random experiment. Events help us focus on what we are interested in within the larger sample space.

## 2. Why It Matters
Probability calculations are done for events, not directly for experiments. Understanding events allows us to ask meaningful questions like “What is the chance of getting a six?” instead of listing all outcomes every time.

## 3. Key Definitions
- Event: A subset of the sample space.
- Simple Event: An event consisting of only one outcome.
- Compound Event: An event consisting of more than one outcome.

## 4. Types of Events
- Certain Event: An event that always occurs.
- Impossible Event: An event that never occurs.
- Complementary Event: The event that occurs when the given event does not occur.
- Mutually Exclusive Events: Events that cannot occur at the same time.
- Exhaustive Events: A set of events that covers all possible outcomes.

## 5. Simple Examples
- Rolling a die:
  - Event A: Getting an even number = {2, 4, 6}
  - Complement of A = {1, 3, 5}

- Tossing a coin:
  - Certain event: Getting either Head or Tail
  - Impossible event: Getting a number

## 6. Common Misunderstandings
- Confusing an event with a sample space.
- Assuming mutually exclusive events are always exhaustive.
- Forgetting to consider the complement of an event.

## 7. One-Line Summary
An event is a selection of outcomes from the sample space, and different types of events help structure probability questions.
