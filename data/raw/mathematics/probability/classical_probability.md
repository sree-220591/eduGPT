# Classical Probability

## 1. Core Idea
Classical probability is a method of calculating probability when all possible outcomes of a random experiment are equally likely.

It is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

## 2. Why It Matters
Classical probability provides a simple and intuitive way to compute probabilities in many basic situations like coins, dice, and cards. It forms the foundation for more advanced probability concepts.

## 3. Key Definition
If an event A has n(A) favorable outcomes and the sample space S has n(S) total outcomes, then:

Probability of A = n(A) / n(S)

## 4. Simple Examples
- Tossing a coin:
  - Event A: Getting Head
  - Probability = 1 / 2

- Rolling a die:
  - Event A: Getting an even number
  - Favorable outcomes = {2, 4, 6}
  - Probability = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2

- Drawing a red card from a standard deck:
  - Favorable outcomes = 26
  - Total outcomes = 52
  - Probability = 1 / 2

## 5. Conditions for Using Classical Probability
- All outcomes must be equally likely.
- The total number of outcomes must be finite.

## 6. Common Misunderstandings
- Applying classical probability when outcomes are not equally likely.
- Forgetting to count outcomes correctly.
- Confusing probability with certainty.

## 7. One-Line Summary
Classical probability calculates the likelihood of an event as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total equally likely outcomes.
