    "question": "What is a random experiment?",
    "answer": "A random experiment is an action or process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty in advance, even when repeated under the same conditions. Examples include tossing a coin or rolling a die, where multiple outcomes are possible.",

    "question": "What is a sample space?",
    "answer": "The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. It is usually denoted by S and must include every outcome that can occur in the experiment.",

    "answer": "An event is a subset of the sample space and represents one or more outcomes of interest from a random experiment. Probability calculations are always performed for events.",

    "question": "What is classical probability?",
    "answer": "Classical probability defines the probability of an event as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of equally likely outcomes in the sample space.",

    "answer": "Classical probability can be applied only when all possible outcomes of a random experiment are equally likely and the total number of outcomes is finite.",
